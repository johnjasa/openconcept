Propulsion Modeling
********************

OpenConcept is designed to facilitate bottoms-up modeling of aircraft propulsion architectures with conceptual-level fidelity.
Electric and fuel-burning components are supported.

Single Turboprop Example
------------------------

This example illustrates the simples possible case (turboprop engine connected to a propeller).
The propulsion system is instantiated as an OpenMDAO `Group`.

Series Hybrid Example
---------------------

This example illustrates the complexities which arise when electrical components are included.
